# Interest Rate Modeling Project

This repository contains the project for Fundamentals of Interest Rate Models course at University of Bologna.

The code is written in MATLAB, and tries to replicate the results in Zhao & Wang (2017) by modeling short-term interest rate based on Vasicek and CIR models for three countries. The aim is to find the model that fits the data better, and to illuminate shortcommings of these simple 1-factor models.

The results achieve similar fit to the reference paper, and highlight the inflexibility of Vasicek and CIR in capturing the full information in actual short-term interest rate due to their limited number of parameters to calibrate.
